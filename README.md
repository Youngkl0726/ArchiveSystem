# ArchiveSystem
This is a system used for managing archive files.
### Using ThinkPHP, I implemented a ArchiveSystem in 2015.1 when I was a student in Hunan University.
### In this repository, there are only php code and html/css/js code.
### There are not any information about database.
### This is my first project and it, of course, had some shortcomings, but I really learned a lot from it.
### The time when I did this project was tough,however, it's a good memory.
